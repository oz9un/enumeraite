# 🔍 Enumeraite: AI-Assisted Web Attack Surface Enumeration

> 🚀 Official release coming after DEFCON 33 — stay tuned!

Enumeraite is a research project that uses AI to help find hidden parts of websites—like subdomains, API paths, and other endpoints. It learns from real-world recon data and tries to guess what might exist but hasn’t been discovered yet. The goal is to help security folks find things that normal tools often miss.

This is not just another recon tool.
This is recon with *pattern recognition*, *contextual awareness*, and *creative generalization*.  
This is **Enumeraite**.

## 📅 Launch Plan

We’ll be uploading the following after the DEFCON 33 Recon Village talk on **August 9, 2025**:

- **Slides** from our presentation  
- **Demo videos** and how-to guides  
- Fine-tuned models (subdomain + path generation)  
- Scripts and CLI tools  
- Public training datasets  
- Real-world examples and case studies  

---

## 🌐 What Enumeraite Can Do

- Learn from existing infrastructure (e.g., `api.apple.com`, `/internal/api/status`)
- Predict new subdomains and paths with LLM-backed generalization
- Help red teamers and bug bounty hunters to expand the attack surfaces
- Automate creative recon that mimics human intelligence

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

Enumeraite is designed for:

- Bug bounty hunters
- Red teamers and pentesters
- Security researchers
- Threat intelligence teams
